# Kubernetes Community Days Amsterdam 2023 - GitOps Patterns for managing cloud-native applications Session

Repository for the KCD 2023 Amsterdam about GitOps Patterns for managing cloud-native applications session.

## Abstract

In this session, we will present some of the best practices for deploying GitOps application workloads in multi-application use cases.

Using Syncwave, Hooks or Application Sets, we will present the advanced deployment patterns in GitOps / ArgoCD and discuss the promotion strategy between clusters in dev, test, stage and prod environments. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how to deploy GitOps Applications to multiple Kubernetes clusters simultaneously, by the means of grouping applications in Application Sets, using various strategies such as GitOps generators.
